    <h1>Europa Clipper Mission</h1>
    <p>Last year, <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/" title="NASA Clipper Mission Homepage">NASA launched a mission</a> to take a closer look at one of Jupiter's moons, <strong>Europa</strong>. Scientists
      believe that the ocean-covered moon could be the best place for hosting life in our solar system (other than Earth of course).
      The spacecraft, <strong>Clipper</strong>, will do dozens of close, high speed passes of the moon, taking up close pictures and other interesting measurements. 
      Because it is so far away, we wont reach the moon <strong>until 2030</strong>, but it is something to look forward to!</p>
